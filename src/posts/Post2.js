            There was nothing so very remarkable
            in that; nor did Alice think it so very much
            out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
            itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!'
            (when she thought it over afterwards, it
            occurred to her that she ought to have
            wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed
            quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
            took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket
            and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice
            started to her feet, for it flashed across her
            mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
            with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to
            take out of it, and burning with curiosity,
            she ran across the field after it, and
            fortunately was just in time to see it
            pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another moment down went Alice after it,
            never once considering how in the world she
            was to get out again.
          </p>
