            'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such 
            a fall as this, I shall think nothing of 
            tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all 
            think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything 
            about it, even if I fell off the top of the 
            house!' (Which was very likely true.) 
          </p>
          <p>
            Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to 
            an end! I wonder how many miles I've fallen by 
            this time?' she said aloud. I must be getting 
            somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let 
            me see: that would be four thousand miles down, 
            I think - ' (for, you see, Alice had learnt 
            several things of this sort in her lessons in 
            the schoolroom, and though this was not a very 
            good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, 
            as there was no one to listen to her, still it 
            was good practice to say it over) ' - yes, that's 
            about the right distance - but then I wonder 
            what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice 
            had no idea what Latitude was or Longitude 
            either, but thought they were nice grand words 
            to say.)
